eig1 missing wedge

eig2 z shift and missing wedge

eig3 some curvature, not good from top

eig4 missing wedge in middle, some rotation of the array?

eig5, c2 type CSUs from top, reinforced density in projections?

eig6, 3 fold yang et al 2019 type motion

eig7, curvature

eig8, curvature

eig9, curvature

eig10 stretched in different directions, non tilt orientation correlation?

eig11, curvature (great for movie)

eig12 weird, dislocation? probably rotational misalignment

eig13 large scale internal motion in the array, central 18 volumes V good for a movie, also c3 c6?

eig14 curvature

eig15 curvature

eig16 large scale internal motion in the array, great for a movie!!
interfacial ToD interface is v interesting here, also C3 C6

eig17 p4 some changes, empty v filled? large motions in array itself

eig18 weird, non tilt orientation classification?

eig19 similar to 18

eig20 similar to 18,19

eig21 similar to 18,19,20,21

eig22 lots of variance outside central hexamer

eig23 presence absence of central density, interfacial sliding, v interesting

eig24, huge scale deformation, very strange!!

eig25 variance at periphery of array in xy plane but also some motions in the central receptor ring! interesting

eig26 huge inter tod motions! piston motions at HAMP

eig27 MW corrupted

eig28 ring shape change? interesting

eig29 strange motions, interested

eig30 change of separation in 3fold ToDs, interesting

eig34, big motion in central ring of ToDs, very cool!

eig35, shape of internal ring of ToDs changes a lot, very cool

eig36, shape of internal ring of ToDs changes a lot, very cool 2

eig37, piston motion of central ring of receptors, v v v cool

eig38, weird motions in internal ToD ring, very cool

eig39, large ring shape changes, v v cool!!

eig40, general ultrastructural expansion/dilation

eig41, array 'slippage' - so so so cool!!!!

eig42, large internal movements, very continuous, very cool!!

eig43, hard to describe but again continuous, interesting motion, 3fold alternating ToD differences

eig44, similar to 43, interesting!!

eig45, big ring shape change, v v v nice for animation!

eig46, array expansion/dilation, beautiful, continuous!
